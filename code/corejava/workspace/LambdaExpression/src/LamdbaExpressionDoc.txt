-> Functional Programming Languages
	1. Functional Programming can be achieved using lambda Expression
	2. using Lambda expression you can use wrap implementation inside function like we do in JS 
	3. To Use lambda Expression you must have a functional interface.
 
 -> Functional Interface
 	1. It is an interface which has only single abstract method.
 	
-> Lambda Expression	
	a. It is an implementation for the abstract method of the functional interface.
	b. There is a syntax to create a lambda expression
		Syntax : () -> {};
		() - Arguments 
		-> - Arrow Token
		{} - Method Execution
